TOP Calculator Project (small)


The aim of this project was to practice DOM manipulation, some CSS and JS functions.  

The code could be a lot more elegant and if I were to refactor, I would most probably make the calculator an object and update the object key->values instead of having so many variables.  Having the code as is makes it challenging to follow the logic and also makes it difficult to debug.  

I would also approach this differently.  I made the classic mistake of not planning out the full functionality prior to writing the beginnings of the JS and HTML.  This caused some refactoring and also a lot of bloat which could be removed.  

In all though, the result is functional, but it could have taken less time with better planning and the result would also be easier for someone else to pick up in the future without having been the original developer.

With more time, I would want to do thef following. There is little point in doing so right now given my current objective is learning and I already know how to do the below:

- Change the calculator to an object
- Add styling transitions with keyboard taps 
- Change the display so that it only shows a subset of numbers when the initial entries are too long (the results are currently OK but you can enter a lot of numbers manually to make numbers overlap the display)
- Change the logic of the number and operator actions so they are condensed.  This would mean some re-ordering of the current code, but would be worth it for future readability.  
- Spent some time on the look and feel of the calculator so that it was more attractive to use (delayed transitions, nice colours, button sizing etc.).
